## About

Gesttalt is a platform for cultivating knowledge and connection through the simple act of planting seeds and tending gardens. Every thought, link, image, or idea you share becomes a **seed** that can grow into something meaningful. These seeds flourish in your curated **gardens** - spaces where related ideas connect, cross-pollinate, and inspire new growth.

Drawing inspiration from [Are.na](https://are.na), Gesttalt believes that when we share our intellectual gardens with others, we create opportunities for serendipitous connections that can spark innovation, empathy, and understanding. By connecting our individual gardens of knowledge, we cultivate a richer, more thoughtful society where ideas can cross boundaries and grow beyond what any single mind could imagine.

Built by [Pedro Piñera](https://github.com/pepicrft) with the standards and principles of the open web, Gesttalt ensures your digital gardens remain authentically yours while being part of a larger ecosystem of human knowledge and creativity.

The platform is designed as **multi-tenant greenhouses** - much like Mastodon instances - where multiple gardeners can cultivate their individual gardens within shared infrastructure. Communities can flourish together whether joining existing greenhouses or creating their own spaces with dedicated groundskeepers for collaborative growth.

### Features

- **Plant Seeds**: Capture thoughts, links, images, and files from across the web as seeds of inspiration
- **Cultivate Gardens**: Organize and nurture your seeds in themed gardens where ideas can grow and connect
- **Cross-Pollinate**: Discover how seeds from different gardens create unexpected connections and insights
- **Share Harvests**: Built on open web principles, allowing your gardens to inspire and nourish others
- **Tend Together**: Collaborative gardens where communities can co-create and learn from each other
- **Grow Sustainably**: Fast, reliable, and scalable architecture powered by Elixir and Phoenix

### Production Infrastructure

The managed greenhouse at [gesttalt.org](https://gesttalt.org) runs on:

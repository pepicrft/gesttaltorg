      Plant seeds of ideas. Cultivate gardens of knowledge. Grow a better society together.

    <p>
      Gesttalt is a platform for cultivating knowledge through the simple act of planting
      <strong>seeds</strong>
      and tending <strong>gardens</strong>.
      Every thought, link, image, or idea you share becomes a seed that can grow into something meaningful. These seeds flourish in
      your curated gardens—spaces where related ideas connect, cross-pollinate, and inspire new growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we share our intellectual gardens with others, we create opportunities for serendipitous connections that spark
      innovation, empathy, and understanding. By connecting our individual gardens of knowledge, we cultivate a richer,
      more thoughtful society where ideas can cross boundaries and grow beyond what any single mind could imagine.

    <.h2 class="gst-Home_storyTitle">Why Gesttalt?</.h2>

    <div class="gst-Home_storyContent">
      <p>
        Our digital identities have become fragmented, scattered across platforms that wall off our content
        behind proprietary systems closed to integration. We express ourselves through Instagram stories,
        social media threads, blog posts, and countless other formats—each locked in its own silo.
      </p>

      <p>
        While publishing once meant blogging, today we share a rich tapestry of content: quick thoughts,
        long-form essays, images, code snippets, audio recordings, and everything in between. Traditional
        blogging engines weren't built for this diversity of expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wanted to concentrate my online presence in one place that would embrace the principles and values
        of the social web. A space that speaks RSS for syndication, integrates with the Fediverse for
        connection, and remains open for interoperability. A platform that doesn't trap your content but
        lets it flow freely across the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, it needed to be developer-oriented. Native clients should be able to publish from
        anywhere—your terminal, your phone, your favorite editor. APIs should be first-class citizens, not
        afterthoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This vision gave birth to Gesttalt, named after the German concept of <em>Gestalt</em>—the idea that
        the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Just as seeds grow into flourishing gardens when nurtured
        with care and connection, Gesttalt transforms your scattered digital fragments into thriving ecosystems
        of knowledge. Each seed you plant contributes to a larger garden of human understanding, where individual
        ideas combine to create insights more profound than any could achieve alone.

    <.h2 class="gst-Home_commitmentTitle">Our Commitment to Free Software</.h2>

    <div class="gst-Home_commitmentContent">
      <p>
        Gesttalt is developed with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs), technologies made possible by the
        countless hours of work from open source contributors and maintainers around the world. Their code, documentation,
        and knowledge have been instrumental in training these AI systems that now help us build software more efficiently.
      </p>

      <p>
        We feel morally obligated to honor their contributions by releasing Gesttalt under a free software license
        (MPL-2.0). We cannot conceive of Gesttalt as a proprietary solution when it stands on the shoulders of so many
        who freely shared their work with the world. This is our way of giving back to the community that made
        these innovations possible and ensuring that the knowledge gardens we're building remain open for all to tend
        and harvest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Free software isn't just about code—it's about preserving the collaborative spirit that allows knowledge
        to flourish and cross-pollinate across boundaries, just like the gardens we're cultivating together.
